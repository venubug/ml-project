# Dog Breed Prediction

Welcome to the Dog Breed Prediction project! This repository utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the breed of a dog based on input images. By leveraging deep learning models, we aim to accurately identify various dog breeds, providing an engaging exploration of computer vision and classification tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Install Dependencies:**

3. **Dataset:**
- Download the dog breed dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

4. **Training:**
- Train the model using the provided scripts. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

5. **Prediction:**
- Use the trained model to predict dog breeds for new images.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Store the dog breed dataset here.
- `models/`: Save trained models in this directory.
- `src/`: Contains source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
